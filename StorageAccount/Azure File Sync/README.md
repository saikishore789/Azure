To synchronize files between an **Azure File Share** and an **on-premises server**, you can use **Azure File Sync**, which is designed specifically for this purpose. Here's a step-by-step guide to implement it:

---

### âœ… **Steps to Set Up Azure File Sync**

#### **1. Prepare Azure Resources**
- **Create a Storage Account** (preferably General Purpose v2).
- **Create a File Share** in the storage account.
- **Create an Azure File Sync service** in the same region as your storage account.

#### **2. Install Azure File Sync Agent on On-Premises Server**
- Download and install the **Azure File Sync agent** on your Windows Server (Windows Server 2012 R2 or later).
- Ensure the server has internet access and meets the prerequisites.

#### **3. Register the Server**
- After installation, use the **Azure File Sync agent** to **register the server** with your Azure subscription.
- This links the on-prem server to the Azure File Sync service.

#### **4. Create a Sync Group**
- In the Azure portal, go to the **Azure File Sync service**.
- Create a **Sync Group**:
  - Add the **Azure File Share** as the **cloud endpoint**.
  - Add the **on-premises server** as the **server endpoint** (specify the local folder path to sync).

#### **5. Configure Sync Settings**
- Choose sync direction (bi-directional by default).
- Configure **cloud tiering** if needed (to save space on-prem by keeping only frequently accessed files locally).

#### **6. Monitor and Maintain**
- Use the Azure portal to monitor sync status, errors, and performance.
- Keep the agent updated and ensure the server remains connected.

### ðŸ”’ **Security & Best Practices**
- Use **Private Endpoints** or **VPN** for secure connectivity.
- Enable **backup** for your file share if needed.
- Set up **alerts** and **logging** for operational visibility.
