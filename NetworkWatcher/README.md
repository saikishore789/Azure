## ðŸ§­ What Is Azure Network Watcher?

Network Watcher provides tools to:
- **Monitor** network performance and connectivity
- **Diagnose** issues with routing, security rules, and traffic flow
- **Visualize** your network topology
- **Capture** packets for deep inspection
- **Audit** traffic using flow logs

It automatically activates in regions where you deploy virtual networks, and it works with IaaS resources like VMs, load balancers, and application gateways.

## ðŸ“Œ Real-Time Scenarios

### 1. **Diagnosing VM Connectivity Issues**
**Scenario**: A web server VM is unreachable from the internet.
**Solution**: Use **IP Flow Verify** to check if NSG rules are blocking traffic. Then use **Connection Troubleshoot** to trace the path and identify where the failure occurs.

### 2. **Visualizing Network Architecture**
**Scenario**: Your team needs to audit the network layout before a security review.
**Solution**: Use **Topology Viewer** to generate a live diagram of all resourcesâ€”VMs, subnets, NICs, gatewaysâ€”and their relationships.

### 3. **Monitoring Latency Between Regions**
**Scenario**: Users report slow performance accessing services hosted in another region.
**Solution**: Use **Connection Monitor** to measure latency and packet loss between VMs across regions or between on-premises and Azure.

### 4. **Capturing Suspicious Traffic**
**Scenario**: You suspect a VM is under attack or leaking data.
**Solution**: Use **Packet Capture** to record traffic and analyze it offline for anomalies or malicious behavior.

### 5. **Auditing NSG Rules**
**Scenario**: A new deployment fails due to misconfigured security rules.
**Solution**: Use **NSG Diagnostics** to verify which rules are applied and whether they allow the intended traffic.
