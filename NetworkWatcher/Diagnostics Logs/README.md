Diagnostic logs in Azure are detailed records of operations and events generated by Azure resources. They help you monitor, troubleshoot, and audit your cloud infrastructure by capturing **resource-specific activity**, such as requests, errors, and performance metrics.

## ðŸ§  What Are Diagnostic Logs?

Diagnostic logs fall into three main categories:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Activity Logs** | Track operations at the subscription level (e.g., resource creation, deletion) |
| **Platform Logs** | Automatically generated by Azure services (e.g., VM boot logs, App Service errors) |
| **Resource Logs** | Detailed logs from specific resources like Azure SQL, Storage, or Key Vault |

You can route these logs to:
- **Log Analytics Workspace** (for querying and visualization)
- **Azure Storage Account** (for archival)
- **Event Hub** (for streaming to external systems)

## ðŸ“Œ Real-Time Scenarios

### 1. **Troubleshooting App Service Errors**
**Scenario**: Your web app is returning 500 errors.
**Solution**: Enable diagnostic logs for the App Service. Review HTTP request logs and error traces to pinpoint the failing endpoint or misconfigured code.

### 2. **Auditing Access to Key Vault**
**Scenario**: You suspect unauthorized access to secrets.
**Solution**: Enable Key Vault diagnostic logs to track who accessed which secret and when. Route logs to Log Analytics for alerting and compliance auditing.

### 3. **Monitoring Storage Account Usage**
**Scenario**: You want to analyze blob access patterns.
**Solution**: Enable diagnostic logs on the Storage Account to capture read/write/delete operations. Use these logs to optimize performance or detect anomalies.

### 4. **Tracking VM Boot Failures**
**Scenario**: A VM fails to start intermittently.
**Solution**: Review platform logs for boot diagnostics. These logs can reveal kernel errors, disk mounting issues, or misconfigured startup scripts.

### 5. **Security and Compliance Reporting**
**Scenario**: You need to prove compliance with GDPR or HIPAA.
**Solution**: Collect diagnostic logs across resources and store them in a secure location. Use Azure Monitor and Log Analytics to generate audit reports.
