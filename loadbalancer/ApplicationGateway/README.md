Azure Application Gateway is a **layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) load balancer** that intelligently routes web traffic to backend resources based on URL paths, host headers, and other HTTP attributes. It's ideal for web applications like e-commerce platforms that need secure, scalable, and efficient traffic management.

## üß† How Azure Application Gateway Works

- **Frontend IP**: Exposes a public or private IP to receive incoming traffic.
- **Listeners**: Monitor incoming requests on specific ports (e.g., 80 or 443).
- **Rules**: Define how traffic should be routed based on conditions like URL path or host name.
- **Backend Pools**: Group of servers (VMs, App Services, etc.) that serve the application.
- **Health Probes**: Periodically check backend server health to avoid routing traffic to unhealthy instances.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Optional security layer to protect against common threats like SQL injection and XSS.

## üõ†Ô∏è Sample Setup: E-Commerce App with 2 VMs

Here‚Äôs a simplified walkthrough to create an Application Gateway for an e-commerce app hosted on two Azure VMs:

### 1. **Create a Virtual Network**
- Name: `ecomVNet`
- Subnets:
  - `appGatewaySubnet` (for Application Gateway)
  - `backendSubnet` (for VMs)

### 2. **Deploy Two VMs**
- VM1: `ecomVM1` (e.g., hosts product catalog)
- VM2: `ecomVM2` (e.g., handles checkout)
- Place both in `backendSubnet`

### 3. **Create Application Gateway**
- Resource Group: `ecomRG`
- Name: `ecomAppGateway`
- Tier: Standard_v2 or WAF_v2 (for security)
- Frontend IP: Public (for internet-facing app)

### 4. **Configure Backend Pool**
- Add `ecomVM1` and `ecomVM2` by IP or NIC
- Backend port: 80 (or 443 if HTTPS)

### 5. **Set Up Health Probes**
- Protocol: HTTP
- Path: `/health` or `/status`
- Interval: 30 seconds

### 6. **Create Listener**
- Protocol: HTTP or HTTPS
- Port: 80 or 443
- Host name: `www.myecomapp.com`

### 7. **Define Routing Rules**
- Rule 1: `/catalog/*` ‚Üí `ecomVM1`
- Rule 2: `/checkout/*` ‚Üí `ecomVM2`

### 8. **Test the Setup**
- Access `http://<frontend-ip>/catalog` and `http://<frontend-ip>/checkout`
- Verify traffic routes correctly and backend health is green
