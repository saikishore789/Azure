Azure Load Balancer is a fully managed service that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple backend resources‚Äîlike virtual machines (VMs), containers, or services‚Äîto ensure high availability, scalability, and performance.

## üöÄ Why Azure Load Balancer Is Useful

Azure Load Balancer helps you:

- **Distribute traffic efficiently** across multiple servers or services.
- **Ensure high availability** by rerouting traffic if one resource fails.
- **Scale applications** horizontally by adding more backend instances.
- **Improve performance** by balancing workloads and reducing bottlenecks.
- **Secure access** using NAT rules and health probes.

## üß≠ Types of Azure Load Balancers

Azure offers several load balancing solutions, each suited for different scenarios:

| Type                     | Layer | Scope         | Use Case                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Azure Load Balancer**  | L4    | Regional      | Distributes TCP/UDP traffic across VMs or containers                     |
| **Application Gateway**  | L7    | Regional      | Web traffic load balancing with SSL termination, URL routing, WAF       |
| **Azure Front Door**     | L7    | Global        | Global HTTP/HTTPS load balancing with CDN, caching, and failover        |
| **Azure Traffic Manager**| DNS   | Global        | DNS-based routing to endpoints based on performance, geography, etc.    |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Azure Load Balancer Works

Azure Load Balancer uses a **five-tuple hash algorithm** to distribute traffic:

- **Source IP**
- **Source Port**
- **Destination IP**
- **Destination Port**
- **Protocol (TCP/UDP)**

It checks the health of backend resources using **health probes** and routes traffic only to healthy instances.

## üìä Real-Time Examples

### üè• Healthcare App
A hospital runs a patient portal hosted on multiple VMs. Azure Load Balancer distributes traffic among them. If one VM crashes, traffic is rerouted to healthy VMs, ensuring uninterrupted access.

### üõí E-commerce Platform
An online store uses Application Gateway to:
- Terminate SSL
- Route traffic based on URL paths (e.g., `/checkout` vs `/products`)
- Protect against threats using Web Application Firewall (WAF)

### üåç Global SaaS Service
A SaaS company uses Azure Front Door to:
- Serve content from the nearest edge location
- Automatically failover to another region if one goes down
- Accelerate performance with caching

### üß≠ DNS-Based Routing
A company with services in India and Europe uses Traffic Manager to:
- Route Indian users to the India datacenter
- Route European users to the EU datacenter
- Switch traffic during outages using priority routing
